					<p class="person__bio">MGIC has a special culture. Our management knows the importance of work-life balance. They encourage us to take the lead at work and insist on the highest standards, but they also know that to do so successfully, you must balance your career with your personal life. That gives me plenty of time for my husband and kids: We love camping, hiking, archery, reading and DIY projects.</p>

					<p class="person__bio">Most of my co-workers have been here more than 20 years, so as a younger person coming in, I immediately had a good feeling that something positive is happening here. After 3 years I can say that MGIC is more like a family than I could have imagined, and people here really care about what they do. No matter what position you hold, you can clearly see how you are necessary for the big picture: helping people get into homes. Feels good.</p>
